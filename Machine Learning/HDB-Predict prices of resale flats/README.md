## Project Objectives
In this project, we will use the past years transaction data on Housing Development Board (HDB) resale flats to build a model to predict prices for resale flats.

This model would be useful for property agencies and real estate companies to have a gauge on the selling prices of the flats.

## Source
Data is downloaded from [data.gov.sg](https://data.gov.sg/dataset/resale-flat-prices)

## Evaluation
For this regression problem, we will use the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) as the main evaluation metric.

## Method
We will build and train our models with Linear Regression, Random Forest Regression, XGBoost and Support Vector Regression and use cross validations to validate our models' performance.
